-----Vue Basics & Core Concepts-----

--Creating and Connecting Vue App Instances--

const app = Vue.createApp();

- creates a Vue app. we use {} inside of the Vue.createApp() to pass in an object we use this objeect to configure the app.

data:

- anything thats part of the object you return in data can now be used in your Vue controlled HTML part.

- data key wants a function as a value. we can use original functions or we can use shorthand functions. this function should do one simple and important thing which is returning an object. With this we can set up and key value pairs with any property names of your choice.

mount()

- lets vue know which part of the page should be controlled by that vue app. Enter the id of the selector you wish vue to use. We use id's because we want unique selectors. This tells vue that we want to connect our Vue.createApp() to a specific id.

--Interpolation and Data Binding--

Interpolation {{}}

- a special syntax that outputs data in the Vue controlled HTML part. Vue will scan the html code to detect certain features and syntax. You can reference your returned data object properties inside of the {{}}. Vue will make that connection and understand that you want to output the content stored inside of the {{}}

--Binding Attributes with the "v-bind" Directive--

- We dont always want to or can use string interpolation. if we want to add a link we cant put our string interpolation inside of a href. in order to do this we need to use Vue binding syntax. This allows us to use a vue directive which is instructions we add in our html code and we can use these directives on html elements like an anchor element for example.

- v-bind

v-bind is a directive and we use v-bind to give vue a set of instructions to do something. we use this to bind/set an attribute on an html element. we then tell v-bind what to bind by adding a : at the end and then adding the attribute after.

v-bind example:

<p>Learn more <a v-bind:href="vueLink">about Vue</a></p>

Tells Vue to find and set the value of the ref attribute to something which is passed in between the opening and closing double qoutes and in there you can reference a value of your data object which is vueLink in this example.

--Methods in Vue Apps--

Methods allow us to define functions which should execute when something happens. Methods takes an object which will be full of methods/functions. THEY MUST BE FUNCTIONS because they need to be callable as functions (original or shorthand functions).

--Working with Data inside of a Vue App--

instead of returning hardcoded strings we can output strings that are defined in data. in order to usae these strings we need to use the this keyword from our data and in our methods function.

--Outputting Raw HTML Content with v-html--

v-html is used to update a element's inner HTML with our data. it allows us to set the content between opening and closing text of an element but you now tell Vue that the content should be interpreted as HTML not text. We no longer have to use {{}} but instead the value you pass to v-html between the double qoutes would be courseGoalB. But this could cause a security issue because youre disregarding the cross side scripting attack protection that comes with using the {{}} (double curly braces)

--Understanding Event Binding--

v-on allows us to react on a certain event just like onClick etc.

Although you can put your logic in html when using Vue it's always best practice to put your JS logic in JS, not html.

We can also use v-on with "event.target.value" JS feature. in order for your event to render first you can place $ infront of event.. $event..

Basics:

Single-File Component (SFC) - a reusable self-contained block of code that encapsulates HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that belong together, written inside a .Vue file.

Declarative Rendering - a template syntax that extends HTML, we can describe how the HTML should look like based on the JavaScript state. When the state changes, the HTML updates automatically.

JavaScript State - describes the status of the entire program or an individual object.

State that can trigger updates when changed are considered reactive. We can declare reactive state using Vue's reactive() API. Objects created from reactive() are JavaScript Proxies that work just like normal objects. reactive() only works on objects.

ref(), on the other hand, can take any value type and create an object that exposes the inner value under a .value property

VUE Attributes:

v-model

used on a component to implement a two-way binding.

v-on

used for listening to DOM events and running some JavaScript when triggered (event listener for on click, on submit, etc.)

v-for

used to render a list of items based on an array
